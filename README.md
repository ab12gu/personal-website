This is a static site generated via a common ruby framework, [Jekyll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jekyll_(software)).
- To run Jekyll web generator locally, install instructions are located [here](https://github.com/ab12gu/personal-website/wiki). 
- The framework was chosen due to its ease of integration with github; however, I don't believe this a great framework.

I have ran into issues with custom settings and organization due to the highly structured format of the framework. Alternatively, using a framework, such as Django, allows one to write beautiful websites mainly in python allowing more versitility, but maintaining language simplicity for quick development. 

Overall, it did help me with development of my stepmom's business [masala blend](https://masalablend.com) as it is developed using the same framework, because it is built on shopify. 

As with anything, there are major pros and cons. 

Let me know if you have any recommendations!
