	<h2 class="headers" id="center">Current Position</h2>

	<p> I took some time off of work and have just recently started a new job search. Outside of job hunting, I occupy most of my time in <a href="http://www.sjbikeclinic.org/">volunteering</a>, personal projects, sports, and socializing.</p>

	<p> My last employment was at <a href="https://kawasakirobotics.com/">Kawasaki Robotics</a>, where I focused on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCARA">scara robots</a> in the automation of wafer handling as a robotics software engineer.</p>

	<p> A few months prior, I was a software engineer at SummerBio. I was developing custom software for hardware components, specifically a <a href= "https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/SPK0001">6 axis robot arm</a> and a <a href=https://us.ohaus.com/en-US/Ranger3000>weight scale</a>. As covid faded, 
	their product demand decreased and they had to shutdown.</p>


	<p> After graduate school, I was a robotics engineer at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G8wXQGEBrA">Lam Research</a>! Although the company was quite large, I was in a small team spanning many projects. </p>

	<p>I mainly developed new software solutions for both our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIcxOGo7ieU">maintenance robot</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JH8ekYJrFHs">instructional Android app</a>, but I also dabbled in our mechanical hardware projects as well! </p>

	<h2 class="headers" id="center">Background</h2>
	<p> My education is in both mechanical and computer engineering. This has allowed me to jump around in many different <a href="http://abgup.com/projects.html">projects</a>. </p>
